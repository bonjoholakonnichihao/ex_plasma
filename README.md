# ExPlasma

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `ex_plasma` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_plasma, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

### Quick Start



Most of the tests should have `exvcr` coverage, but for those that don't and need a live service, that's
where docker comes in:

```sh
docker-compose up
```


Then run the tests. Optionally, with `iex` to pry into the code

```sh
iex -S mix test
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/ex_plasma](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_plasma).
